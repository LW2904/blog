title: "So I Have a Blog Now"
---

I figure since this is my first post I'll both outline what I want this blog to be, and how I made it.

The latter already hints at the former, for this blog is supposed to be a technical one. I am neither a great writer nor particularly witty, so I expect this to be rather dry at times - quite fitting, really, for many will probably find the topics to be the same.

Leading us to what this will all be about. Well, I don't know yet. I build stuff, mostly by writing code. It's what I enjoy doing, and what I am always eager to learn more about. It is my hope that I will be able to share this process of learning, maybe even allowing others to benefit from it.
